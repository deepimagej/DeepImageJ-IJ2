### The ImageJ plugin to run deep-learning models

DeepImageJ is a user-friendly plugin that enables the use of a variety of pre-trained deep learning models in ImageJ. The plugin bridges the gap between deep learning and standard life-science applications. DeepImageJ runs image-to-image operations on a standard CPU-based computer and does not require any deep learning expertise.

## One-click Installation
The ZIP file (DeepImageJ.zip) is a plugin for ImageJ or Fiji. It contains all the necessary libraries (JAR files) to load and run TensorFlow models on any OS: Windows, Mac OSX, Linux.

Unzip the ZIP file and store the 5 JAR files into the plugins folder of ImageJ or Fiji.

Create the folder models inside ImageJ/Fiji directory (".../ImageJ/models/").

Download a bundled model (https://deepimagej.github.io/deepimagej/models.html), unzip it into the directory 'models' and run it over your image!

## System requirements
Operating systems (same requirements as for ImageJ/Fiji software).
* Windows
* Mac OSX
* Linux.

The java libraries insided ImageJ/Fiji needed to run this plugin are:
* libtensorflow-1.12.0
* libtensorflow_jni-1.12.0
* proto-1.2.0
* protobuf-java-3.2.0
